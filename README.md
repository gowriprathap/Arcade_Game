# Arcade Game Udacity FEND Project #

## Game Description ##
A fun game to challenge you to dodge the bugs and reach the water stream to score points.

## How to Play ##
The player can use the up, down, left and right arrow keys to operate. The player must reach the water using the arrow keys by avoiding collisions with the enemy bugs. Collision with the enemy bugs results in the player being placed at initial position again. On 15 collisions, the game is over. The "score" gives the number of collisions suffered by the player. The "moves" give the number of moves the player has made. Reaching the water ends the game and will let the player know how many moves, collisions and time it took to finish the game.
